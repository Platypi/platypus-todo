# PlatypusTS TodoMVC Example

> PlatypusTS is a framework focused on assisting with writing scalable cross-platform applications. The framework is written in TypeScript in order to take advantage of all its benefits. It is possible to write a vanilla JS app using PlatypusTS, but the recommended approach is to embrace TypeScript.

## TypeScript

> TypeScript is a language for application-scale JavaScript development. TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. Any browser. Any host. Any OS. Open Source.

> _[TypeScript - typescriptlang.org](http://typescriptlang.org)_

> [TypeScript](http://typescriptlang.org) is a superset of JavaScript, with optional type annotations. As any JS is valid TS, there is no interoperability issue. You could slowly convert an existing JS code-base and use JS libraries natively. You already know most of the language. It compiles back to JS.

> It's attractive to people with a background in strongly typed languages, who are willing to type in more code-- classes and type annotations-- receiving the benefit of type checking on compile time. IntelliSense works better as well.

## Implementation

> ### Editors
>> A great editor for TypeScript is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).

>> #### Other editors include:
>>> * [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) + [TypeScript plugin](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-Sublime-Plugin)
>>> * [Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)
>>> * [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/)

> ### Ambient declarations

>> It is useful to have type information for the libraries you use. [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/borisyankov/DefinitelyTyped) is a nice collection of annotations by Boris Yankov.

> ### Files

>> * `*.ts` are source code files.
>> * `*.d.ts` are ambient declarations for interfaces and libraries.
>> * `*.js` are generated by the compiler.
>> * `*.js.map` are [source maps](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/) generated by the compiler, for better debugging experience.

>> The best place to start is by looking at 'js/viewcontrols/todo.viewcontrol.ts' and 'js/viewcontrols/todo.viewcontrol.html'.
